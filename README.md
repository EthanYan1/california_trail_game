This project is a school extra credit project for Social Studies based on the California Trail. 

Brief California Trail History:

The California Trail was used to reach gold mines and fertile farmland, and was mainly used by gold miners and farmers between 1841 and 1869. 
Many men traveled either with a mule, on horseback, or getting pulled in a wagon by a mule, horse, or oxen.
